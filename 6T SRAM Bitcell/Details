6T SRAM Cell Design and Simulation

This repository contains the design and simulation of a 6T SRAM cell, a fundamental memory cell used in SRAM arrays for data storage. The 6T SRAM cell is composed of six transistors: two cross-coupled inverters to hold data and two access transistors for read/write operations.

Overview

Hold Operation: The cell maintains its stored value without any read or write operation.

Read Operation: Data is read without altering the stored value.

Write Operation: Data in the cell is updated by forcing a new value through the access transistors.


Simulations

1. Hold Operation

Description: This simulation verifies the stability of the stored value in the cell when no operation is performed.

Simulation Results: (Attach an image here for the hold operation simulation)


2. Read Operation

Description: This simulation checks the ability of the cell to output the stored value without disruption.




3. Write Operation

Description: This simulation ensures that the cell can be correctly updated with new data.

Simulation Results: (Attach an image here for the write operation simulation)
